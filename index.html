            <p>Kristina Centore is a writer, artist, curator, and musician based in Philadelphia, PA. She is currently a student in the MA program in Art History at the Tyler School of Art and Architecture at Temple University. In addition, Centore has nearly a decade of experience working in the museum field, having professionally managed complex logistics for major exhibitions, led group tours in contemporary art galleries, and worked hands-on in film and media archives.</p>
            <p>Centore’s research interests include “global” modern and contemporary art and technology in a broad sense, with a special focus on modernisms in parts of the world that were formerly territories of the Ottoman Empire. Currently, Centore is working on a thesis project related to art in Egypt after WWII that considers the roles of temporalities, decolonization, and networks of artistic exchange within art production.</p>
            <p>Prior to attending Tyler, Centore received her BA in Visual Art from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ, where she was an active member of the city’s thriving DIY art and music community. Relocating to Philadelphia shortly thereafter, Centore became a member of Space 1026, an art collective and gallery space, where she maintained a studio practice and curated exhibitions including <cite>Forever/Siempre</cite> (2018), featuring muralist Layqa Nuna Yawar’s meditations on the current migration crisis at the US/Mexico border. Centore also participated in a film curatorial collective associated with Ladyfest Philadelphia (2013), which programmed several events featuring the work of women and gender non-conforming individuals. Highlights included screenings at the International House Philadelphia (now the Lightbox Film Center) and AUX (Vox Populi Gallery) in Philadelphia, with selections ranging from contemporary international short films to Cheryl Dunye’s <cite>The Watermelon Woman</cite>.</p>
            <p>Centore’s art practice spans multiple media, but primarily consists of time- and process-based work. Particularly, Centore has worked in the medium of stop-motion animation, and her work has been exhibited at venues including Vox Populi Gallery, the Icebox Project Space, and the Snyderman-Works Gallery in Philadelphia. Centore also developed a mobile workshop designed to interactively teach the art of stop motion animation to the general public, and participated in the DUMBO Arts Festival in Brooklyn, NY between 2012-2015.</p>
